- 👋 Hi, I’m @mamrakm
- 👀 I’m interested in professional Java development with Spring (Boot) and related stuff such as JPA/Hibernate, MapStruct, OpenAPI, Lombok etc.
- 🏡 As a hobby I'm interested in Scala, Kotlin and Haskell. I'm no expert but it's fun to me.
- 🌱 I'm continuously learning all I can about Java and Spring development and when I have some spare time also Scala/Haskell/Kotlin, FP and such.
